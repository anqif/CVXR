Description: An object-oriented modeling language for disciplined
    convex programming (DCP) as described in Fu, Narasimhan, and Boyd
    (2020, <doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i14>). It allows the user to
    formulate convex optimization problems in a natural way following
    mathematical convention and DCP rules. The system analyzes the
    problem, verifies its convexity, converts it into a canonical
    form, and hands it off to an appropriate solver to obtain the
    solution. Interfaces to solvers on CRAN and elsewhere are
    provided, both commercial and open source.
