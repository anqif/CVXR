\title{Reduce a problem data tensor for efficient construction of the problem data}
\usage{
reduce_problem_data_tensor(A, var_length, quad_form = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A sparse matrix, the problem data tensor. Must not have a 0 in its shape.}

\item{var_length}{Numeric, number of variables in the problem.}

\item{quad_form}{Logical, if TRUE, consider quadratic form matrix P. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item reduced_A: A CSR sparse matrix with redundant rows removed
\item indices: CSC indices for the problem data matrix
\item indptr: CSC indptr for the problem data matrix
\item shape: The shape of the problem data matrix
}
}
\description{
This function reduces a problem data tensor by removing rows that are identically zero.
It returns the reduced tensor along with indices and indptr to construct the problem data matrix
from the reduced representation, and the shape of the problem data matrix.
}
\details{
If quad_form=FALSE, the problem data tensor A is a matrix of shape (m, p), where p is the
length of the parameter vector. The product A \%*\% param_vec gives the entries of the problem
data matrix for a solver; the solver's problem data matrix has dimensions (n_constr, n_var + 1),
and n_constr * (n_var + 1) = m.

If quad_form=TRUE, the problem data tensor A is a matrix of shape (m, p), where p is the
length of the parameter vector. The product A \%*\% param_vec gives the entries of the quadratic
form matrix P for a QP solver; the solver's quadratic matrix P has dimensions (n_var, n_var),
and n_var * n_var = m.
