## How to use `pickle`

```{r}
#' Pickle an R object to load in python
#' @param x an R object that is transferrable to python
#' @param fname the name to use for the pickle file
#' @examples
#' pickle(list(a = 1.0, b = 2L, x = matrix(1:20, nrow = 5), y = rnorm(5)), "foo.pickle")
#' ## Then, on the python side
#' ## import pickle as pk
#' ## with open("foo.pickle", "rb") as f:
#' ##    l = pk.load(f)
#' ## Now l is a dict on the python side with components l['a'], l['x'] etc.
pickle <- function(x, fname) {
  io <- reticulate::import("io")
  f <- io$open(fname, mode = "wb")
  pk <- reticulate::import("pickle")
  pk$dump(x, f)
  f$close()
}
```
